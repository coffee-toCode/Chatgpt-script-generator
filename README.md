# python-chatgpt-generator

This Python script generates Python code using the OpenAI API. It takes a prompt as a command line argument and generates Python code based on that prompt using the OpenAI API.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
The requests library (pip install requests)
The argparse library (included in Python)
The dotenv library (pip install python-dotenv)


Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create an account on the OpenAI website and obtain an API key.
3. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the repository and add the following line to it, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key:
4. Install the required Python libraries using pip.
5. Run the script using the command python generate_code.py "prompt" "file_name", replacing "prompt" with your desired prompt and "file_name" with the desired name for the file where the generated code will be saved.

Usage
The script takes two command line arguments:

prompt: the prompt to send to the OpenAI API
file_name: the name of the file where the generated code will be saved
For example, to generate Python code that creates a list of numbers and saves it to a file named my_list.py, you would run the script with the following command:

    python generate_code.py "create a list of numbers and save it to a file named my_list.py" "my_list.py"

The script will send the prompt to the OpenAI API and generate Python code based on the prompt. If the response from the API is successful, the generated code will be saved to the specified file.

Customization
The script is designed to be customizable based on your specific use case. You can modify the following variables in the script to customize the behavior:

    api_endpoint: the URL of the OpenAI API endpoint (default is "https://api.openai.com/v1/completions")
    api_key: your OpenAI API key, loaded from the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
    request_headers: the headers to send with the API request (default includes content type and authorization token)
    request_data: the data to send with the API request (default includes the prompt, OpenAI model, and generation parameters)
    
You can modify these variables to change the behavior of the script, such as using a different OpenAI model or changing the generation parameters.
